I recently needed to create a choropleth of a few different countries
for a project on targeting of UN peacekeepers by non-state armed actors
Iâ€™m working on. A
[choropleth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choropleth_map) is a type of
thematic map where data are aggregated up from smaller areas (or
discrete points) to larger ones and then visualized using different
colors to represent different numeric values.

See this simple example, which displays the area of each county in North
Carolina, from the `sf` package
[documentation](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/articles/sf1.html#sfc-simple-feature-geometry-list-column-1).[^1]
First, we need to load `sf` and then get the built-in `nc` dataset:

``` r
library(sf)
nc <- st_read(system.file('shape/nc.shp', package = 'sf'))
plot(nc[1])
```
